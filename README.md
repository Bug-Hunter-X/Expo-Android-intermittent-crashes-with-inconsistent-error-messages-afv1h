# Expo Android Intermittent Crash Bug

This repository demonstrates a bug encountered in an Expo React Native application resulting in intermittent crashes on Android devices.  The crashes were unpredictable and presented inconsistent error messages, making debugging challenging.  The application would sometimes freeze, leading to a blank screen. The iOS version of the app did not exhibit this issue.

## Reproduction Steps

1. Clone this repository.
2. Navigate to the project directory.
3. Run `expo start`.
4. Install the app on an Android device (emulator or physical device).
5.  Use the application,  crash behavior is sporadic.
