While developing a React Native application using Expo CLI, I encountered an issue where the application would crash intermittently during runtime.  The error messages were inconsistent and didn't pinpoint the exact cause. The application would often freeze, leading to a blank screen.  Debugging proved difficult due to the lack of specific error information.  This occurred only on Android devices, iOS devices worked correctly.
